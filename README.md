# INRAS-internship

Implementation of profile inversion methods for vertical ionograms. There are also programs to retrieve information from .sao and .ngi files in `sao_reader.ipynb` and `get_ngi.ngi`, respectively.

## Methods
- Chebyshev polynomials
- Quasi-Parabolic Method

# Auxiliar

- `GetIonogram_analytical.py` tries to compute the virtual height given an electron density profile through analytical means. A brief explanation of the algorithm can be found in `report1.pdf`.
- `chapman_ionogram` was one of the first programs I made just to see how the electron density profile proposed by Chapman was
